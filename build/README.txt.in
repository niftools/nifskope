NifSkope is a tool for analyzing and editing NetImmerse files (.nif)

This is version @VERSION@ of NifSkope.

Known Issues and Workarounds
----------------------------

* Do not install nifskope whilst blender is running.

* Be warned that collada export is still very experimental. It may, or
  may not, work for you.

* On some graphic cards textures show up black or distorted. If this happens,
  uncheck "Shaders" in NifSkope's settings.

* Models with multiple texture maps may appear to be missing some textures,
  but they will become visible when some texture maps are disabled. This is
  due to the limited number of texture units in graphics hardware.

* If one of NifSkope's windows disappears due to moving it to a location
  outside of the desktop view, close NifSkope and remove the NifSkope settings
  by deleting the registry key(s)

    HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-***\Software\NifTools\NifSkope-***

  Launch NifSkope again, and all windows will appear at their default
  position.

* If NifSkope does not start at all, check your firewall. NifSkope uses the
  network (locally, nothing is sent to the outside world) to communicate with
  itself.
