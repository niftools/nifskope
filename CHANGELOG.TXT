   extension such as linux with vanilla xorg drivers, so DDS textures show up
   even when S3TC extension is not supported in the driver (code ported from
   nvidia texture tools project).
 * Started adding doxygen-style documentation in some source files.
 * Added nifcache and texcache to nif file extension list (used by Empire Earth III)

changes since 1.0.2:
 * Installer
  - fixed link where user can download MSVC redistributables

changes since 1.0.1:
 * User Interface
  - another attempt at fixing the delete block crashes

changes since 1.0:
 * User Interface
  - visualize skin partitions for versions < 10.2.0.0
  - fixed \r \n issue.  (Embedded carriage returns can be added using the Shift+Enter or Alt+Enter keys.)

  - Add ByteMatrix data type for NiPixelData
  - extra space in text editor to ensure that single line strings are nicely displayed on edit
  - Allow for multiple file filters in the file open and save dialogs.

  - fixed display of multiline strings (without affecting the actual data)
  - syncing strip pack spell with xml

      1. Added skeleton PhysX blocks from copetech examples
      2. Fixed NiSortNode
      3. Fixed NiPixelData to better match file format
      4. Fixed NiBoneLODController
  - fixes for ffvt3r 10.1.0.0 nifs (capsule NiCollisionData)
  - fixed NiGeometryData for 10.1.0.0 nifs
  - Fixes for NiCollisionObject and Multiline text in nifskope.
  - number of vertices in oblivion sub shapes
  
changes since 0.9.8:
 * User Interface
  - Expanded help menu and renamed "Reference Browser" to "Interactive Help" and made it come up when F1 is pressed.
  - Merged autodetect buttons into a single button which looks for every supported game so you can auto-detect all our games at the same time.
  - The custom paths you've specified will no longer be deleted by the autodetect button.
  - File names displayed in the load and save box should now always have the full path and show long file names on Windows.  They should also contain back slashes instead of forward slashes.
  - Added Vertex and Triangle Selection to bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape
  - Linux file select fix
  - The BSXFlags selection box works again
  - Improved FloatEdit to accept "<float_min>" and "<float_max>".
  - Added Draw Constraints option.
  - Added check if array is even enabled to "Update Array" spell
  - Created new icons for "Follow Link" and "Flags" spells just for fun.
  - Created an icon for "Array Update" and made the spell instant, so now arrays can be updated just by clicking the icon.
  - Made the Matrix4 edit spell "instant" so that the icon would appear next to the Matrix and the user won't have to drill down into the right-click menu.
  - Created some more amusing icons for the various view toolbar buttons.
  - Reformatted the insert block menu to make a little more sense.  "Havok" instead of "BHK," grouped other Bethesda and Firaxis nodes, etc.
  - Added version matching to XML checker.
  - Changed link editing so if you clear the value and press enter, the link changes to "None."  This way the user won't have to know that "-1" has a special meaning.
  - Fixed block-matching so it works for all versions, though it won't be any faster for old versions since early rejection can't be used.
  - Fixed NiControllerSequence links so that 0x0000FFFF also counts as "empty" instead of showing up as "invalid index"
  - Added the ability to specify what NIF version the new "blank" NIF is when NifSkope starts.
  - Changed relative path specifier to './'
  - Fixed issue where links in old files weren't mapped if the file didn't load completely.
  - The XML checker window's Block choosing button now has the same new menu structure as the Block > Insert spell.

 
 * 3D View
  - Added ability to center the view on the selected node or shape.  Select the node/shape and press the C key.
  - Made it so you can zoom in and out by right-dragging left and right as well as up and down.
  - Added Text Rendering when "Triangles" is selected on the bhkNiTriStripsShape data.  If the top is selected all triangles are numbered if a specific one is selected then only that triangle index is shown.
  - Removed triangle sorting of alpha meshes because none of the games or official scene viewers actually seem to do this.  Improves display of Oblivion hair meshes.
  - Fixed, added, or improved several Havok Constraint visuals.
  - Added support for displaying textures in NiTextureProperty (Nif ver. 3.x)
  - Made selection lines look much less flickery by increasing the line width to 1.5 before drawing them.
  - Added visualization for old style collision boxes.  Lumped it in with "Havok" since it's the same idea as a Havok box shape.
  - A warning will appear if S3TC texture compression is not supported by the OpenGL driver.

 * Spells
  - Update Center/Radius" spell now respects CF_VOLATILE and Oblivion simple center searching methods.
  - Enhanced LimitedHingeHelper spell to every constraint
  - "Edit UV" is applicable only when there are texture coordinates present and fixed bug which could lead to crashing.
  - The Optimize > Combine Shapes spell now issues warnings when shapes don't count as matching due to the presence of unsupported NiObjects, such as NiSkinInstance.
  - The Multi Apply Mode spell is now on the "Batch" page of the spell book, and only appears in the Spell menu, never in the right-click menu.
  - Edit UV is now only applicable to NiTriShape or NiTriStrips. It didn't work for NiTriShapeData or NiTriStripsData, but would show up in the right-click menu anyway.
  - Added the ability to not stripify and pad newly created NiSkinPartition objects in the "Make Partition" spell.  Still needs more work to make proper partitions for games which require 4 bones per partion, however.

 * Import/Export
  - 3ds and OBJ import updated so that all the NiTriShapes will be attached to whatever NiNode is selected in the tree view, similar to the old right-click->Import method.
  - Added the ability to import the first mesh from an OBJ or 3DS file over the top of the selected NiTriShape object.
  - Added the ability to export starting from the specified node, or only a specific mesh, depending on what is selected.
  - Import and export now warn the user what they are about to do, based on the selection, giving them a chance to cancel the operation if it isn't what they wanted.
  - Fixed 3ds import for shapes with multiple materials.
  - Optimized 3ds import a bit so that group nodes will only be created when there is more than one material in a shape.
  - Updated Import 3ds so that it creates a "Scene Root" node which all object nodes are attached to, rather than creating a NIF file with many roots.
  - Fixed a the same bug in 3ds import as was fixed in OBJ import where "Has UV" was not being set properly.
  - Fixed OBJ and 3ds import and export so that NiImage and NiTexture are created in 3.x files, and are detected during OBJ export.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the "Has UV" bool not to be set correctly when an OBJ file was imported.
  
 * NIF Compatibility
  - Added partial support for the following new games: Loki, Pro Cycling Manager, Shin Megami Tensei
  - Fixed a bug that made NifSkope fail to load the 3.3.0.13 file.
  - Fixed problem with version 3.03 conditions in the XML.  Version 3.1 files can be read again.
  - XML changes which allow NiSkinPartition objects that won't crash Morrowind and Freedom Force to be created.
 
 * Misc. 
  - GCC build fixes.
  - Added check for empty QFileSystemWatcher, this removes the nasty qWarning
  - Uninstall now correctly removes all folders.

  - some small tweaks:
    - paste branch now automatically parents ninode branches to the selected ninode
    - ipc over udp ensures that new NifSkope windows are allways opened in the same
      application instance (this makes the 'new window' workaround obsolete when
      copying and pasting between nifs on windows platform)
      note that this works by opening a local udp server socket. communication on
      this socket is limited to local host only. so it shouldn't be a security issue.
